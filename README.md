This upload zip folder contains two ipynb file:

* __5318_a2.ipynb__ : This file is including the whole assignment including feature selection, model training and so on. It have4 4 stage, ***you can skip to `Stage4` to run the saved model***.
	
	- Stage1. `Data Processing and Feature Selection` about calculate the correalation, importance of features, using one-hot encoding method and so on.
				
	- Stage2. `Model Buidling` building 3 models(Multilayer perceptron Regressor, Support Vector Regressor,)and adjust paramaters for each model 
	- Stage3. `Choosing Model and Save Model`compare the performance of 3 models and save them 
	- Stage4. `Load Model and predict the test data` use the test data(never join in to training) to compare the performance again.
	
* __bestmodel.ipynb__ : This file is including some necessary data prosscessing part and Multilayer perceptron Regressor model which have best performance.  <font color=#0099ff size=5 face="黑体">***Just run it!!!*** </font>

Both file you maybe need to change the csv route.
### ***Thanks for your reading!***
